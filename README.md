# HomeworkManager #

This is a small app i am developing as part of my MYP year 4 project. The main objective is to make an app that is both simple and quick to use for students. 
The app knows the user's timetable and therefore  can also know when they have their current class next and so auto-complete the subject and due date, allowing the user to focus on just writing the homework.
